   * Translation and tracking tables to map in-vat object/promise references

   *
   * Exports: pass-by-presence objects (Remotables) in the vat are exported as
   * o+NN slots, as are "virtual object" exports. Promises are exported as p+NN
   * slots. We retain a strong reference to all exports via the
   * `exportedRemotables` Set until the kernel tells us all external references
   * have been dropped via dispatch.dropExports, or by some unilateral
   * revoke-object operation executed by our user-level code.
   *
   * Imports: o-NN slots are represented as a Presence. p-NN slots are
   * represented as an imported Promise, with the resolver held in an
   * additional table (importedPromisesByPromiseID) to handle a future
   * incoming resolution message. We retain a weak reference to the Presence,
   * and use a FinalizationRegistry to learn when the vat has dropped it, so
   * we can notify the kernel. We retain strong references to unresolved
   * Promises. When an import is added, the finalizer is added to
   * `vreffedObjectRegistry`.
   *
   * slotToVal is a Map whose keys are slots (strings) and the values are
   * WeakRefs. If the entry is present but wr.deref()===undefined (the
   * weakref is dead), treat that as if the entry was not present. The same
   * slotToVal table is used for both imports and returning exports. The
   * subset of those which need to be held strongly (exported objects and
   * promises, imported promises) are kept alive by `exportedRemotables`.
   *
   * valToSlot is a WeakMap whose keys are Remotable/Presence/Promise
   * objects, and the keys are (string) slot identifiers. This is used
   * for both exports and returned imports.
   *
   * We use two weak maps plus the strong `exportedRemotables` set, because
   * it seems simpler than using four separate maps (import-vs-export times
   * strong-vs-weak).

  /*
    Imports are in one of 5 states: UNKNOWN, REACHABLE, UNREACHABLE,
    COLLECTED, FINALIZED. Note that there's no actual state machine with those
    values, and we can't observe all of the transitions from JavaScript, but
    we can describe what operations could cause a transition, and what our
    observations allow us to deduce about the state:

    * UKNOWN moves to REACHABLE when a crank introduces a new import
    * userspace holds a reference only in REACHABLE
    * REACHABLE moves to UNREACHABLE only during a userspace crank
    * UNREACHABLE moves to COLLECTED when GC runs, which queues the finalizer
    * COLLECTED moves to FINALIZED when a new turn runs the finalizer
    * liveslots moves from FINALIZED to UNKNOWN by syscalling dropImports

    convertSlotToVal either imports a vref for the first time, or
    re-introduces a previously-seen vref. It transitions from:

    * UNKNOWN to REACHABLE by creating a new Presence
    * UNREACHABLE to REACHABLE by re-using the old Presence that userspace
      forgot about
    * COLLECTED/FINALIZED to REACHABLE by creating a new Presence

    Our tracking tables hold data that depends on the current state:

    * slotToVal holds a WeakRef in [REACHABLE, UNREACHABLE, COLLECTED]
    * that WeakRef .deref()s into something in [REACHABLE, UNREACHABLE]
    * deadSet holds the vref only in FINALIZED
    * re-introduction must ensure the vref is not in the deadSet

    Each state thus has a set of perhaps-measurable properties:

    * UNKNOWN: slotToVal[baseRef] is missing, baseRef not in deadSet
    * REACHABLE: slotToVal has live weakref, userspace can reach
    * UNREACHABLE: slotToVal has live weakref, userspace cannot reach
    * COLLECTED: slotToVal[baseRef] has dead weakref
    * FINALIZED: slotToVal[baseRef] is missing, baseRef is in deadSet

    Our finalizer callback is queued by the engine's transition from
    UNREACHABLE to COLLECTED, but the baseRef might be re-introduced before the
    callback has a chance to run. There might even be multiple copies of the
    finalizer callback queued. So the callback must deduce the current state
    and only perform cleanup (i.e. delete the slotToVal entry and add the
    baseRef to the deadSet) in the COLLECTED state.

   * This 'dispatch' function is the entry point for the vat as a whole: the

   * dispatch.deliver) to execute. Here in liveslots, we invoke user-provided
   * code during this time, which might cause us to make some syscalls. This
   * userspace code might use Promises to add more turns to the ready promise
   * queue, but we never give it direct access to the timer or IO queues
   * (setImmediate, setInterval, setTimeout), so once the promise queue is
   * empty, the vat userspace loses "agency" (the ability to initiate further
   * execution), and waitUntilQuiescent fires. At that point we return
   * control to the supervisor by resolving our return promise.
   *
   * Liveslots specifically guards against userspace reacquiring agency after
   * our return promise is fired: vats are idle between cranks. Metering of
   * the worker guards against userspace performing a synchronous infinite
   * loop (`for (;;) {}`, the dreaded cthulu operator) or an async one
   * (`function again() { return Promise.resolve().then(again); }`), by
   * killing the vat after too much work. Userspace errors during delivery
   * are expressed by calling syscall.resolve to reject the
   * dispatch.deliver(result=) promise ID, which is unrelated to the Promise
   * that `dispatch` returns.
   *
   * Liveslots does the authority to stall a crank indefinitely, by virtue of
   * having access to `waitUntilQuiescent` and `FinalizationRegistry` (to
   * retain agency), and the ability to disable metering (to disable worker
   * termination), but only a buggy liveslots would do this. The kernel is
   * vulnerable to a buggy liveslots never finishing a crank.
   *
   * This `dispatch` function always returns a Promise. It resolves (with
   * nothing) when the crank completes successfully. If it rejects, that
   * indicates the delivery has failed, and the worker should send an
   * ["error", ..] `VatDeliveryResult` back to the kernel (which may elect to
   * terminate the vat). Userspace should not be able to cause the delivery
   * to fail: only a bug in liveslots should trigger a failure.
